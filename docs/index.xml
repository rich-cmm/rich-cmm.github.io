      <description>A sound engineer for a decade (some twenty years ago - the systems I know now feature in the &amp;lsquo;heritage&amp;rsquo; pages), itinerant contractor/temp for a few more years (including a stint answering Gordon Brown&amp;rsquo;s correspondence) and now a Detective Constable for the London police service that isn&amp;rsquo;t CoLP.
Currently working on a central London robbery squad having come from a south London CID &amp;lsquo;main office&amp;rsquo;.
Keen amateur technologist, I set my first website up at school in &amp;lsquo;96 and still occasionally dine out on that triumph and narrowly missed the opportunity to become a Dotcom millionaire by virtue of the fact that I lived in deepest, darkest rural Essex.</description>

      <description>In this age of Substacks and Mediums, I have decided to revert to an old fashioned blog, similar to the sort of sites I used to chuck up in the late nineties (does anyone else remember Geocities?) in the hope that someone else finds it useful.
This won&amp;rsquo;t be an unfiltered stream-of-consciousness, because a) it&amp;rsquo;s implicitly linked to my real identity and b) I&amp;rsquo;m not Dom, so nobody is going to be that interested in it.</description>
