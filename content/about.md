A sound engineer for a decade (some twenty years ago - the systems I know now feature in the ['heritage' pages](https://www.dbaudio.com/global/en/products/filter/heritage/)), itinerant contractor/temp for a few more years (including a stint answering Gordon Brown's correspondence) and now a Detective Constable for the London police service that *isn't* CoLP.

Currently working on a central London robbery squad having come from a south London CID 'main office'.

Keen amateur technologist, I set my first website up at school in '96 and still occasionally dine out on that triumph and narrowly missed the opportunity to become a Dotcom millionaire by virtue of the fact that I lived in deepest, darkest rural Essex.

Occasional runner and cyclist, small business owner and hound wrangler.
