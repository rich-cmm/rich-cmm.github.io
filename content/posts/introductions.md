In this age of Substacks and Mediums, I have decided to revert to an old fashioned blog, similar to the sort of sites I used to chuck up in the late nineties (does anyone else remember Geocities?) in the hope that someone else finds it useful.

This won't be an unfiltered stream-of-consciousness, because a) it's implicitly linked to my real identity and b) I'm not Dom, so nobody is going to be *that* interested in it. 

What I will do is pop some words up about work (investigations, policing, boarding kennels(!)) plus some really geeky bits about bikes.
